# Present Tense

Use present tense for statements that describe general behavior that's not associated with a particular time.

## Recommended Examples

- Click the button to save your changes. The system displays a confirmation message.
- When you delete a file, the application moves it to the trash folder.
- Run the test command. The framework executes all test cases and reports the results.

## Not Recommended Examples

- Click the button to save your changes. The system will display a confirmation message.
- When you delete a file, the application will move it to the trash folder.
- Run the test command. The framework will execute all test cases and report the results.

## When Future Tense is Appropriate

Use future tense (will) to distinguish an action that will occur in the future:

- Schedule the deployment for tonight. The changes will go live at midnight.
- Submit your request now. You will receive an email confirmation within 24 hours.
- Enable notifications in settings. The app will alert you when new messages arrive.

## Avoid

- Hypothetical future "would": Instead of "If you enabled notifications, the app would alert you," write "If you enable notifications, the app alerts you."
- Future tense to describe how products will work after releases
- Unnecessary future tense for immediate actions
