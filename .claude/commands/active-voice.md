# Active Voice

Use active voice (where the subject performs the action) instead of passive voice (where the subject receives the action). Make clear who's performing the action.

## Recommended Examples

- The developer writes unit tests. The framework executes them automatically.
- Open the configuration file. The editor highlights syntax errors immediately.
- The API returns authentication tokens. Your application stores them securely.
- Press the Deploy button. The pipeline builds and releases your code.

## Not Recommended Examples

- Unit tests are written. They are executed automatically by the framework.
- The configuration file is opened. Syntax errors are highlighted immediately.
- Authentication tokens are returned. They are stored securely by your application.
- The Deploy button is pressed. Your code is built and released by the pipeline.

## When Passive Voice is Acceptable

Use passive voice in these specific cases:

- **To emphasize an object over an action:**

  - The credentials are encrypted.
  - User data is backed up nightly.

- **To de-emphasize a subject or actor:**

  - Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered during testing.
  - The feature was deprecated in version 2.0.

- **When readers don't need to know who's responsible:**
  - The servers were upgraded last weekend.
  - New policies were implemented company-wide.

## Avoid

- Passive constructions that obscure responsibility: "Bugs were introduced" → "The latest commit introduced bugs"
- Using "by" to force passive voice: "The API is called by the client" → "The client calls the API"
- Vague passive constructions: "It is suggested that..." → "The team suggests that..."
