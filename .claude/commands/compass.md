I am writing a note about "$ARGUMENTS".

I want to use the Idea Compass methodology to find new ideas to connect it to. I will tell you the title of my note.

The Idea Compass is structured as follows: Imagine the four compass directions. Each direction helps define the idea in different ways.

## North: Upstream

1. Origin of X: What are the origins of X?
2. Roots in Beliefs: What beliefs support or are embodied by X?
3. High-Level Perspective: What is the domain that exists an order of magnitude higher than X?
4. Birth of X: What factors or events led to the creation or emergence of X?
5. Causation: What are the underlying causes of X?

## West: Reinforcing

1. Similarities: What are some aspects that are similar to X?
2. Existing Applications: In what other disciplines does X already exist?
3. Potential Applications: What other disciplines could benefit from the application of X?
4. Alternative Expressions: What are other ways to express or implement X?

## South: Downstream

1. Potential Outcomes: Where can X potentially lead to?
2. Contributions: What contributions does X make to its field or society?
3. Grouping: What group or category could X serve as a headline for?
4. Lower-Level Perspective: What domain exists an order of magnitude lower than X?
5. Nurturing: What concepts, theories, or practices does X nurture?

## East: Transformative

1. Competition: What aspects, ideas, or entities compete with X?
2. Opposition: What can be considered as the opposite of X?
3. Gaps: What elements or factors is X missing?
4. Disadvantages: What are the disadvantages associated with X?
5. Enhancement: What strategies or tools could significantly enhance or supercharge X?

Imagine you are linking to other similar Wikipedia-style articles that focus on one main idea. These "articles" should be broad and brief in title. What are some possible X links you could make?

Please explain your reason for choice for each link.
