I'm writing a note about "$ARGUMENTS".

I want to use the Idea Compass methodology to find new ideas to connect it to.

The Idea Compass has four directions. Each direction helps define the idea in different ways.

## North: upstream

1. Origin of X: What are the origins of X?
2. Roots in beliefs: What beliefs support or are embodied by X?
3. High-level perspective: What domain exists an order of magnitude higher than X?
4. Birth of X: What factors or events led to the creation or emergence of X?
5. Causation: What are the underlying causes of X?

## West: reinforcing

1. Similarities: What aspects are similar to X?
2. Existing applications: In what other disciplines does X already exist?
3. Potential applications: What other disciplines could benefit from X?
4. Alternative expressions: What are other ways to express or implement X?

## South: downstream

1. Potential outcomes: Where can X potentially lead?
2. Contributions: What contributions does X make?
3. Grouping: What group or category could X serve as a headline for?
4. Lower-level perspective: What domain exists an order of magnitude lower than X?
5. Nurturing: What concepts, theories, or practices does X nurture?

## East: transformative

1. Competition: What competes with X?
2. Opposition: What's the opposite of X?
3. Gaps: What's X missing?
4. Disadvantages: What are X's disadvantages?
5. Enhancement: What could enhance or supercharge X?

Link to other Wikipedia-style articles that focus on one main idea. These articles should be broad and brief in title. What X links could you make?

Explain your reason for each link.
