# Capitalization

Use proper capitalization following American English rules. Avoid unnecessary capitalization.

## Key Guidelines

- Only capitalize when there's a clear reason
- Use sentence case for titles and headings
- Don't rely on capitalization to convey meaning
- Avoid ALL-CAPS except for official names, standard abbreviations, or code references

## Examples

**Titles and headings:**
- "Getting started with the API" (not "Getting Started With The API")
- "Database configuration options" (not "Database Configuration Options")

**After colons:**
- "Popular frameworks: React and Vue" (proper nouns capitalized)
- "Team motto: 'Ship fast, break things'" (quotations capitalized)
- "Remember this: always test your code" (regular text lowercase)

**Lists:**
- Configure the database connection
- Set up user authentication  
- Deploy to production

**Avoid style names:**
- Say "Use no spaces and capitalize each wordâ€”for example, UserAccount"
- Don't say "Use camelCase format"

## Action

Review your writing and remove unnecessary capitalization. Use sentence case consistently.
