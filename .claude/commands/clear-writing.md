# Clear writing

Improve clarity and readability in documentation and content by applying clear writing principles.

## Writing principles

### Use fewer words
Cut unnecessary words. Be direct and concise. If you can say it in three words instead of ten, do it.

### Write Conversationally
Use simple language. No jargon. Write like you're talking to a friend, not giving a lecture.

### Use Contractions
Write it's, you'll, we're, let's, don't instead of the full forms. Sounds more natural.

### Lead with What Matters
Put the most important information first. Make next steps clear and obvious.

### Cut the Fluff
Remove words that don't add value. Every word should earn its place.

### Capitalize Less
Use sentence case for headings. Only capitalize proper nouns and the first word.

### Skip End Punctuation
Don't add periods to short headings, titles, or list items under four words.

### Use Serial Commas
Include the comma before "and" in lists: red, white, and blue.

### Single Spaces
Use one space after periods, not two. No spaces around dashes.

### Start with Verbs
Begin instructions with action words. Cut "you can" and "there are" phrases.
