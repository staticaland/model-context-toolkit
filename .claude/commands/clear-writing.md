# Clear writing

Improve clarity and readability in documentation and content by applying clear writing principles.

## Writing principles

### Use fewer words

Cut unnecessary words. Be direct and concise. If you can say it in three words instead of ten, do it.

### Write conversationally

Use simple language. No jargon. Write like you're talking to a friend, not giving a lecture.

### Use contractions

Write it's, you'll, we're, let's, don't instead of the full forms. Sounds more natural.

### Lead with what matters

Put the most important information first. Make next steps clear and obvious.

### Cut the fluff

Remove words that don't add value. Every word should earn its place.

### Capitalize less

Use sentence case for headings. Only capitalize proper nouns and the first word.

### Skip end punctuation

Don't add periods to short headings, titles, or list items under four words.

### Use serial commas

Include the comma before "and" in lists: red, white, and blue.

### Single spaces

Use one space after periods, not two. No spaces around dashes.

### Start with verbs

Begin instructions with action words. Cut "you can" and "there are" phrases.

## Common replacements

- "In order to" → "To"
- "You can do this by" → "Do this:"
- "There are several ways" → "Try these:"
- "It is possible to" → "You can"
- "Please be aware that" → "Note:"
- "We recommend that you" → "We recommend"
- "If you're ready to" → "Ready to"
- "You need an ID that is valid" → "You need a valid ID"
